# Super Resolution Project Data Extraction Code

The code in src can be used to generate samples from the HSC/HST images
stored in the data directory.

The code expects the working directory to be the root directory of this
repository.

To add locations to extract, add corrdinates in the list `hsc_sample_locations`
declared at src/extract_sample.py:L108

You can download the files by running the `/data/download_data` script
